# **MLflow Experiment Tracking & Hyperparameter Tuning** 🚀  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains Python scripts and resources for **experiment tracking, model training, and hyperparameter tuning** using **MLflow**. The goal is to streamline ML workflow by logging experiments, tracking metrics, and optimizing models efficiently.  

## **Folder Structure**  
📂 **src/** – Contains all the main Python scripts for MLflow runs:  
- **`first.py` & `first2.py`** – Initial MLflow local runs.  
- **`autolog.py`** – MLflow AutoLogging implementation for automatic artifact tracking.  
- **`hypertune.py`** – Hyperparameter tuning using **Random Forest** with GridSearchCV, tracking experiments with MLflow.  
- **`mlflow_autolog_pros_and_cons.txt`** – Notes on the pros and cons of using MLflow’s autologging feature.  
- **`mlflow_basics_notes.txt`** – Basic notes on MLflow functionalities and usage.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **Local & Remote MLflow Runs** – Ran experiments locally and also on **DagsHub** for remote access.  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimized `n_estimators` and `max_depth` using **GridSearchCV** while logging results in MLflow.  
✅ **AutoLogging** – Enabled automatic logging of parameters, metrics, models, and datasets.  
✅ **Parent-Child Runs** – Nested tracking of multiple experiment runs.  
✅ **Dataset Tracking** – Logged input data for versioning & reproducibility.  

## **How to Use**  
1️⃣ Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
cd your-repo-folder
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3️⃣ Run experiments locally:  
```bash
python src/hypertune.py
```
4️⃣ Access MLflow UI:  
```bash
mlflow ui
```
5️⃣ Check the logs and artifacts in **MLflow UI**.  

## **Additional Notes**
